# Timesheet Tracker

## Overview

This is a simple amolication for collecting, storing and aggregating timesheet records. 

It is in an early development stage.  I intend to stablize it, add just a few major features, and then refine and refactor it to a higher standard.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Frontend**: React
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
